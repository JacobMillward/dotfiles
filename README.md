# .files

This repository contains my dotfiles for macOS and Linux.
## Installation

To install these dotfiles, clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JacobMillward/dotfiles.git
```

Then, run the installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installation script will copy symbolic links from the dotfiles in this repository to their corresponding locations in your home directory. The scripts _should_ be idempotent, so it should be safe to run the install script multiple times.
